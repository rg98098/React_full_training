Q1:   What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples
Ans:  Using img tag: 
      1. Set the src that is url or thr path of the image and alt attribute.
      eg: <img src="https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png" alt="React Image" />

      Setting a background image:
      Using CSS you can set the background of any element. This is most use when 
      you want to display content over the image.
      eg:   .app {
                background-image: url(https://reactjs.org/logo-og.png);
             }
      
      With the <img/> tag:
      Drag your image into your project and import it into the desired component. 
      Afterward, you can insert the name of the import into the source property.
      eg: 
      import reactLogo from "./reactLogo.png";

      export default function App() {
        return <img src={reactLogo} alt="react logo" />
      }

      Inserting a local background image:
      Just like before you would import the image. Then you would insert it using CSS 
      URL(â€¦) or using inline styling as shown below.
      eg: 
      import reactLogo from './reactLogo.png'

      export default function App() {
         return <div style={{ backgroundImage: reactLogo }}>Overlay text</div>
      }

Q2:   What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?
Ans:  It will return an array of length 2. First is default value passed to 
      useState via argument, and second will be a function.

Q3:   How will useEffect behave if don't add a dependency array?
Ans:  useEffect will trigger after every render, if we don't pass dependency array.

Q4:   What is SPA?
Ans:  SPA stands for Single page application. SPA is a implementation of web application that
      load a single web document. It allows user to route the page without reloading the whole 
      web page.

Q5:   What is the differnce between Client side routing and Server side routing?
Ans:  In Server side routing , when a user click on a link then browser makes an http request for that page
	    on server now server process the request and send a response usually a html page, now bowser discard the 
      old page and loads the new page.

      In client side routing , when use click on a link , now client side code catches the event look for the
      the like if the url is not an external then it prevents the browser to make  request.
      then routing library changes the url in brwoser with help of html histroy api and routing libary changes
      the states and loads component on client side. sometimes if it require client app request data from server
      only data not pages, and loads new component on client side.
